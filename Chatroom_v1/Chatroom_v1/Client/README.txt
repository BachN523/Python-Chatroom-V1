=====================

This application consists of two parts: 
	a client (Client.py) and a server (Server.py).

Dependencies:
- Python 3.7 or higher
- socket module (built-in)
- sys module (built-in)

Client Setup:
-------------
1. Open another console instance
2. Navigate to the directory containing Client.py
3. Run the following command:
   python Client.py 127.0.0.1
   
   Note: If Server.py is not running locally, 
	replace 127.0.0.1 with the server's valid IPv4 address
4. The client program will run in the console

- For detailed documentation, 
	refer to the header comments in the source code of both Client.py and Server.py

Note: Ensure that the server is running before attempting to connect with the client.
